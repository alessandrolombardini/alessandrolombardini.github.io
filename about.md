Hi, welcome to my blog! 

My name is Alessandro Lombardini, a graduate in Engineering and Computer Science with a keen interest in Machine Learning. I like math, problem-solving and coding, all things that I find incredibly stimulating and exciting. I also have a weakness in the humanities, which is perhaps the reason why I am very attracted by Natural Language Processing.
