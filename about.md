My name is Alessandro Lombardini, a bachelor graduate in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Bologna with a keen interest in Machine Learning. 

I like math, problem-solving and coding, all things that I find incredibly stimulating. I also have a weakness in the humanities, which is perhaps the reason why I am very attracted by Natural Language Understanding.

Today I’m working as an R&D Researcher in a company called Maggioli, in Italy. My purpose is to do research about solutions of Artificial Intelligence that can be used to offer new services to customers. Specifically, I mainly deal with Natural Language Understanding, the field in which I have specialized more until now. My first main project is about a Question Answering problem.

In my spare time I like climbing and hiking. I also enjoy trekking, I find it extremely exciting.
