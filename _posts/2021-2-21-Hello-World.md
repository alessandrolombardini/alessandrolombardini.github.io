Hi everyone, my name is Alessandro Lombardini, I am an AI lover who wants to share his knowledge and his passion for Artificial Intelligence with a community of people that maybe can find it useful and interesting. I am nobody to talk about it: I don’t have any work experience and any degree in AI; anyway I’m very interested in the argument and I feel the urge to give my contribution to the sector, even if it is tiny.

Before starting to talk, I think it’s appropriate to tell something about myself. I’m Italian, I have 22 years and in October of the past year, I graduated in Computer Science and Engineering, at the University of Bologna. For this year I will not be a student, but I’m evaluating which university attend the next year: a master's degree very focused on AI and Data Science fields it’s the most likely choice.

### Why am I writing?

Why I am writing this text? Well, for different reasons.

First of all, am not very good at writing in English: in my life, I haven’t had so many opportunities to improve my writing and speaking skills, so now I feel the urge to improve them. Writing articles in English I think is a very good opportunity to do it, but it is also useful to gain some experience in writing articles in general and to get involved in something new, something out of my comfort zone.

Secondly, I think a blog is a good opportunity to get in touch with a lot of people with my same interests, and I find this possibility very attractive. I always love telling stories and listen to them, and the opportunity to know new people with very different backgrounds and life stories is very exciting for me. Making contents about what I like I hope it can be a good way to reach this target: I see articles as a good way to present myself, to let know other people (that could be also companies or other subjects with which I want to collaborate) who really I am and how much I like what I do.

These are the reasons. Not very poetic, but much pragmatic.

### What will I write about?

I think I will write mainly about AI, but everything I find interesting can be a perfect subject for an article. Some experience that can be useful for another one can also be a perfect argument to talk about: so many times I didn’t find the answer I was looking for; let the people know how I reach them and what I discovered I think it can be very helpful.

### What am I doing now?

Today I’m working as an R&D Researcher in a company called Maggioli, in Italy. My purpose is to do research about solutions of Artificial Intelligence that can be used to offer new services to customers.

Specifically, I mainly deal with Natural Language Processing, the field in which I have specialized more until now. My first main target is, in fact, doing some scouting about the Close Domain Q&A task solutions.
