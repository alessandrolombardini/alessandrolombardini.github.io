Hi, welcome to my blog!

Who am I?

I'm Alessandro Lombardini, a 23 years old from Italy with a keen interest in Machine Learning. 

If you want to know more about myself check the <a href="https://alessandrolombardini.github.io/who-am-i/">About</a> section.

Why a blog?

I've always felt the need for a place like this. I think is a good way to collect all my experiences and projects, a place where I can see and reach all what I did in an easy way. A place that can also be shown to other people, so that they can see what I have done and what really excites me.

Do I write?

Yes. Or at least I'am trying. 

I really like writing, so at the beginning of 2020 I started to do it on Medium. So far I have written about AI and some of my projects, in the future who knows. 

If you are interested, <a href="https://alessandro-lombardini.medium.com/">here</a> is my Medium'page. I also link every article I wrote on the <a href="https://alessandrolombardini.github.io/articles/">Articles</a> section of this blog.
